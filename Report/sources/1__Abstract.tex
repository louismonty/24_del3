In the present project, we developed a Monopoly Junior game for Windows OS users. The project followed a Unified Process style of workflow including the following two phases: elaboration and construction. The analyses for the project included a requirements specification, actor and use-case analyses and a domain analysis. The designs for the project included a system-sequence, sequence and design class analyses. The implementation resulted in a playable Monopoly Junior game with zero or undetected bugs. For tests, JUnit tests were conducted for each relevant software class along with a user test for the entire program.
